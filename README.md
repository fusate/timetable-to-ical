This is a tool for converting swansea timetable links to an ical format.  see https://mytimetable.swan.ac.uk for the root timetable tool, which does not allow guest users to generate iCal links.  

# TO-DO

- fix modules calendars; requesting many calendars at once results in no events being returned
- https
- rate limiting
- host on the wider internet for ical subscriptions
- directly request data from mytimetable API rather than unofficial one
